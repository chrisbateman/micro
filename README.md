Please note that this isn't quite stable - it's intended to be a resource for myself and not a library for production use. For now at least. And it seriously needs some unit tests.

That said, these functions cover pretty much everything I ever need on small projects, and it's far smaller than jQuery or anything like that.

Feel free to contribute!
